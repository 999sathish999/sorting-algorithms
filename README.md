# Sorting Algorithms
Sorting algorithms implemented in different languages (for hacktoberfest :D).

If there's an existing folder named with your chosen language, create a file for your new algorithm inside, calling it by the algorithm name and using the appropriate file extension i.e. `bubbleSort.js`. If there aren't any algorithms using your chosen language, feel free to start your own folder and place your implementations inside!

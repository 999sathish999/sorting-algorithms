# Sorting Algorithms
Sorting algorithms implemented in different languages (for hacktoberfest :D).

# Contributing
Create a folder with the name of the sorting algorithm if is not already exists. Use only alphanumeric chars and dashes.

Save your implementation with the same name as folder, also add file extension. Title folder as "sorting alg name"-"langage used"

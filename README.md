# Sorting Algorithms
Sorting algorithms implemented in different languages (for hacktoberfest :D).

If there's an existing folder named with your chosen language, create a file for your new algorithm inside, calling it by the algorithm name (camelCase) and using the appropriate file extension. If there aren't any algorithms using your chosen language, feel free to start your own folder and place your implementations inside!
